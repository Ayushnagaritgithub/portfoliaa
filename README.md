A portfolio is a curated collection of work, assets, or investments that are assembled and presented to showcase a person's or entity's accomplishments, skills, or holdings. Portfolios are commonly used in various fields such as finance, creative industries, real estate, and project management. They serve as a powerful tool for demonstrating expertise, evaluating performance, making investment decisions, or highlighting achievements. The specific content and purpose of a portfolio depend on the context in which it is used.
